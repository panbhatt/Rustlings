# Rustlings
This Repository contains all the examples from the Rust Book. This is going to be a REPO for me to store my Rust documentation and the program I am creating in between. 

I am following Let's get Rusty Channel on youtube that will take us through the RUST Documentation and coding at the same time. 

## RUST INSTALLATION
### Linux: Simple just on single line on LINUX 
```
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 https://sh.rustup.rs -sSf | sh
source "$HOME/.cargo/env"
rustc -V  
cargo -V
```
### Windows: Its quite complex, lets leave it.
